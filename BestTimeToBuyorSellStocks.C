/*
Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Blind 75)
Description: You are given an array 'prices' where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example:
Input: prices = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4}
Output: 5 (Buy on day 2 at price 1 and sell on day 5 at price 6. Profit = 6 - 1 = 5)

Constraint: Solve this with a single pass O(N) time complexity and O(1) space.
